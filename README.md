# Yoga Scheduler Bot 🧘‍♂️🕒

Telegram bot for automating the scheduling of group yoga sessions across different time zones.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Simplify the coordination of training times for participants located in different parts of the world. The bot handles the routine of converting time from UTC to each user's local time zone and helps visually assess if a group is forming (minimum participants).

---

## 💡 Idea and Features

- **Timezone Personalization:** The bot reads the user's time zone from the configuration and shows time buttons in their local format.
- **Dynamic Calendar:** Date selection is limited to the current week (4x2 grid), minimizing unnecessary clicks.
- **Automatic Calculation:** When selecting a time, the bot instantly displays a list: how this time will look in Helsinki, London, New York, etc.
- **Interactive Group Gathering:**
- 'I'm in' and 'Can't make it' buttons with protection against repeated clicks.
- Automatic status 'Session confirmed' when the minimum number of participants is reached.
- **Yoga Humor:** Reward system — the bot shows a random yoga joke as soon as the group is gathered.
- **Administration:** The `/shutdown` command is available only to the owner (the first one in the `users.json` list).

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Resources)

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Library:** `aiogram 3.x` (asynchronous work with Telegram API).
- **Data Storage:** `JSON` (for user configuration and UTC offsets).
- **State:** `FSM (Finite State Machine)` for remembering selected dates.

### 📦 Installing Dependencies

The project uses the `requirements.txt` file to manage libraries. Before running, execute the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

---

### 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows

```

3. **Install dependencies** from the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

4. **Prepare the bot**

- Create a bot via @BotFather in Telegram and get the **API TOKEN**.
- Insert the token into your `main.py` code (in the `BOT_TOKEN` variable).

5. **Configure users** (`users.json`)

Create a `users.json` file in the root folder. The first user in the list will become the **Administrator**.

```json
{
  "user_1": 2,
  "user_2": 3,
  "user_3": -5
}
```

_The key is the Telegram username (in lowercase), and the value is the UTC offset._

6. **Run the bot**:

```bash
python main.py

```

## 📝 Usage

1. Send the /yoga command to the bot.
2. Select a day of the week (the buttons automatically adapt to the current date).).
3. Choose a convenient time slot (the time on the buttons will be shown in your local time zone).
4. The bot will post a final message featuring a calculated time list for all configured cities.
5. Click "Going" and wait until the required minimum number of participants is reached for the bot to share a joke!

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- **Security:** The bot responds to the `/shutdown` command only from the first user in `users.json`.
- **Lowercase:** All logins in `users.json` must be in lowercase for correct search.
- **Time Offset:** The current version uses static numbers. When switching to daylight saving time/winter time, values in `users.json` need to be updated manually.

**Have a productive workout!**
